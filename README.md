## Welcome to VirtSH

# NOTICES:
You will need lua and python install on your computer to run this program!

VirtSH will have most of the features that IreSH has but I am planning to add more in the future

# Installation:

Install by downloading the source code and running the executable. (Allows you to edit VirtSH to your liking.)
If your on windows you will have to recompile the whole project and change anything that says python3 to python. (Sorry pals)

Make sure to make an alias in your startup commands file (bashrc zshrc fishrc etc.)
Make sure all of the project files are in the same directory, or you could change the code yourself to the path of the file you want.

OR

You can use the docker image! (Easier and Recommended, but the quick shells use the docker vm)
Open your commandline and run these two commands! (You will need docker installed.) (And it supports windows!)

```
docker pull saturndev/virtsh
```

```
docker run -it saturndev/virtsh
```

# Features:

Check the source code for easter eggs :-)

Weather

Search

Quick access Shells

Calculator

And more!

# Credits:
Not everything was made by me :)
