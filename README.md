## Welcome to VirtSH, the successor of IreSH(https://github.com/vSolarWater/IreSH2)

Instead of being made with Python(https://python.org) only, I decided to make it with C++ and Lua(https://lua.org)

# NOTICES:
You will need lua install on your computer to run this program!

VirtSH will have most of the features that IreSH has but I am planning to add more in the future

# Installation:

Install by downloading the source code and running the executable.
If your on windows you will have to recompile the whole project. (Sorry pals)


# IreSH Questions:

Q. Why did you discontinue it? A. The source files broke and I couldn't update IreSH.

Q. Are you planning to bring it back? A. Maybe...

# Features:
